# VR-Labyrinth

Things to check:
- Is Sci-Fi map tall enough. If not, increase the height of whole Sci-Fi map to 1.1 or 1.2.
- Does triggers work properly?
- If you find any flaws in the map, please contact me or if it's minor, fix it yourself.
- If you find spelling mistakes, please fix it.

Instructions for starting the game:
When you start the game, all the object has to be initialised accurately. 
- Play has to be either "WASD Player" or "XR Origin" or "XR Origin" and "XR Device Simulator" depending on what you want to play with.

* Child objects that are not stated below must be active. (e.g. Fourth room/Area F4/Night sky is not mentioned so it must be active.)
